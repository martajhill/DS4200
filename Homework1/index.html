    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>My name is Marta Hill and I am a fourth-year journalism major at Northeastern University. 
        I am from right outside of Minneapolis and honestly do miss the weather there. Outside of classes I help run a national nonprofit and play competitive Ultimate Frisbee.
        While I don't know what I am doing post graduation yet, I hope to be a science writer! </p>

    <p>Here is what I want to add to this website:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A summary of my trip to Hawaii</li>
        <li>More information about my post grad plans</li>
        <li>Future Data Science class projects</li>
      </ul>
